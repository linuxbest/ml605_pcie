-- Description: This is the Increment Control Register for a single 
--              Statistic Counter.  
--
--              A toggle on the relevent bit of the increment_vector bus
--              will be detected here.  When a toggle occurs, the 
--              Increment Control Register is set to logic 1.  The 
--              statistics logic will service each counter in round 
--              robin sequence: after the round-robin sequence has 
--              passed, a logic 1 on an Increment Control Register will    
--              have caused the relevent statistic counter to increment: 
--              the increment control register will then reset to
--              logic 0.
